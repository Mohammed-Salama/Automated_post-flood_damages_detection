# Flood Detection in Satellite Images

This project focuses on detecting floods in satellite images using various approaches. It is divided into three main tasks:

## 1. Classical Approaches

- Random forst classifier:

## 2. Deep Learning Approach

- ResNet50:


## 3. Segmentation of Flooded Area (Unsupervised)

- ISODATA Clustering:
